# Developing Qt Desktop Applications in Python

The growth of the Python programming language has been impressive in the last couple of years.
Many fields like Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, Web Development and Data Science are using
Python language extensively for their needs.
Qt framework for C++ is regarded as one of the best frameworks for developing
cross-platform Desktop applications. One of the most popular projects
using Qt is KDE for their KDE Plasma Desktop environment.

The Goal of this talk is to showcase how Qt can be used from inside Python to quickly
develop Desktop applications that can be built and sent to the users without
requiring any form of web deployment or python and package installation on the target machine.
This loop is rather useful for quickly developing Desktop apps that have a short life
span but can improve the workflow of the users like labeling images,
testing out Machine Learning models and similar.
We will be developing a couple of Desktop apps live in order to demonstrate the basic workflow, packages and classes.
